# Belly Button Challenge: Module 14

## Objective

The goal for this challenge was to create an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dropdown menu on the sidebar allows users to cycle through the different subject IDs, revealing their demographic information, a bar graph ranking of the microbial species present in their samples, as well as a bubble chart showing the quantity and density of each value in the samples. 

## Dependencies and Implementation
This static website utilizes html and js to display the data, which is fetched from an S3 hosted json file. The visualizations are generated using the d3 library and plotly.
